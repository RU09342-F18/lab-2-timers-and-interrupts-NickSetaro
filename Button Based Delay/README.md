# Button Based Delay
This code uses timer and button interrupts to determine the rate that an LED blinks at. The LED begins to blink at a set rate once the code is initialized. After the user presses the button the new rate that the LED blinks at will be equal to the time the button was pressed for. Pressing the button for less than one second or longer than 6 seconds can cause issues due to the clock speed. This code does not implement button debouncing so successive button presses will be registered multiple times and cause the LED to blink at an incorrect rate.
