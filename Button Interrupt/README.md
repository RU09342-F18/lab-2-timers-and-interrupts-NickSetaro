# Button Interrupt
This code uses a button interrupt to determine if an LED should be on. When the button is pressed the LED will toggle on and when it is released it will toggle off again. Debouncing has not been implemented so rapid button presses can cause the LED to be on while the button is not pressed and off while it is pressed.
