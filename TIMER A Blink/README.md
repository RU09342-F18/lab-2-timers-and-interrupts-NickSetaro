# TIMER A Blink
This code uses timer interrupts to toggle two LEDs at different rates. The timer interrupt is sent when the capture and compare register overflows after reaching a certain value. Each time that the timer interrupt goes off the counter for each LED is incremented. When the counter reaches a certain value it will toggle the LED. This allows the user to set the speed for each LED by changing the value that the counter has to reach before it toggles.
